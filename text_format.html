     <hr>
     <p>The <strong>Shanivar Wada</strong> was normally the seven-story capital building of the <em>Peshwas of the Maratha Empire.</em> It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of <mark>Satara </mark>(the national capital) complained to the <u>Chhatrapati Shahu</u> I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the <i>Peshwas</i>. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone.</p>
